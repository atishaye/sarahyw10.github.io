#VoteOn
-Hack'20 Project https://sarahyw10.github.io Formatted to fit Google Chrome Team Member: Janavi Chadha, Ted Wang, Melinda Chen, Sarah Wehelie, Atishaye Jain

#About
-VoteOn is an idea we got regarding the current issues going on in the US right now. It came from our own experiences when it came to voting and the fact that the voter might feel overwhelmed by the elections and and wanted to make it easier for them by placing how they vote and where to vote in one place.

#How we split up the work:
-UI and UX Design: Melinda and Janavi Developers: Sarah, Ted, Atishaye

#Challenges
-We made our prototype for the project from an interactive website. We grossly underestimated the amount of time it would take to implement all the necessary components. We wanted to use the Google Civic Information API so that the user can search for the polling locations near them, but most of us are beginners with using API and Javascript. Also, most of us are first timers in terms of participating in a hackathon.

#Back-End
Used https://newsapi.org for Javascript API and allows user to search for any topic using a keyword.

 - Overall, one thing we can guarantee is that despite not being able to accomplish everything on time, each one of us did try our best to do what we can and are proud of how we were able to work together in such a short time!
